# Testing

Use an isolated Python environment and install `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
Run `ruff format --check .`, `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, `pytest`, and `python -m build`.
The repository CI matrix covers Python 3.10 and 3.14 on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
New regressions live alongside the existing core/CLI tests.

Setext regressions cover repeated underlines, adjacent thematic breaks, and thematic breaks following bullet/ordered list items, alongside fenced and repeated/renamed headings.
